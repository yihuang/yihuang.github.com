==========

* YunYue Inc. 2012.10 - 2015.10

  Co-founder, Tech Leader, Full stack developer.

  We developed cross platform mobile games for iOS/android.

  We built a set of tools so we can use flash as game designer.

  We used python/cython/gevent to develop a high performance TCP long connection game server, which is capable of horizontally scale.

  We built our persistence solution based on redis-nds, which embed lmdb library with redis, allow for some keys to be stay on disk rather than memory. What we contribute is fixing several serious pointer-related bug which is hard to track, including memory leak and dangling pointers. (https://github.com/yihuang/redis/tree/nds-2.6)
