Work Experience
===============

* **Boyaa Interactive, Senior game engine developer**  (2015.11 - 2017.12)

  I joined Boyaa to help to improve their in-house mobile 2d game engine.
 
  In the end, I wrote a brand new engine and UI framework with backward compatibility and migrated most of their products
  to the new engine.

  The engine is written in c++ and Lua, running on both iOS and Android, based on opengles2.0.

* **YunYue Tech, Co-founder** (2012.10 - 2015.10)

  I co-founded this company and lead the tech team. We made mobile RPG games for iOS/Android.

  I used python/cython/gevent to develop a high-performance long connection game server, which is capable of horizontally scaling.
  Some parts of the project are open sourced on my Github page.

  I built our persistence solution based on redis-nds, which embed lmdb library with redis, providing a lovely database solution for game server.
  What I contribute is fixing several serious memory-related bugs which is hard to track, including memory leak and dangling pointers. (https://github.com/yihuang/redis/tree/nds-2.6)

  I also built our game engine and UI framework solution based on cocos2d-x.

* **ZhongLu Fund, Tech Leader** (2010.09 - 2012.10)

  I lead the tech team(5 people) to build fund news portal, fund investment simulation service, and fund trade system with web technology.
 
  I'm the tech leader and full stack developer, used python, django, jquery, jquery-ui, postgresql.

* **Tencent, C++ Developer** 2007.07 - 2010.09

  I joined QQ Music team of Tencent after graduation and developed high concurrency server applications in c++.

Haskell Experience
==================

I've spent much time to learn Haskell and read a lot papers about the language and GHC implementation,

I've written a streamlined parsing library in Haskell which is used by Yesod project.

I've given several talks about Haskell.

I'm quite confident in writing real-world Haskell code.
